# SKA-PCS
It's the SKA summer internship project, astronomical image reconstruction using parallel compress sensing technique

* debug:
note the line 294 in nufft_init.m, run with normal.

* lib:
Matlab wavelet toolbox
Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox Apps

* Progressï¼š
Using Matlab Coder to convert code,sparse matrix is a problem.
Maybe we can use matlab parallel computing toolbox,it supports MPI&CUDA as well.
